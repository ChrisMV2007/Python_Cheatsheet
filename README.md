# Python_Cheatsheet
## BRIEF HISTORY
A collection of everything I have learned in python; was keeping it in pycharm but decided to move it to Github as well. 
Originally this file was for freecodecamp's python course,, but I started adding to this again ~1 month ago and got
an extra 1400 lines on it (7/13/2022), so maybe worth sharing. Gonna update this pretty much daily whenever I learn anything.

## IF YOU PLAN TO RUN IT
This cheatsheet is mostly syntax; note that if you run this cheatsheet will could potentially throw an error because all files are based on directories from my computer. I you want to run it, you will have to copy the whole git (not just the CheatSheet.py file). You also will need to download stack overflow's 2021 survey (it is used for a section on pandas) and save the 2 csv files as "stack_overflow_2021_survey_data" and "stack_overflow_2021_survey_results" in the "CheatSheet_FileIO" folder.
