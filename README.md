# Python_Cheatsheet
## BRIEF HISTORY
A collection of everything I have learned in python; was keeping it in pycharm but decided to move it to Github as well. 
Originally this file was for freecodecamp's python course,, but I started adding to this again ~1 month ago and got
an extra 1400 lines on it (7/13/2022), so maybe worth sharing. Gonna update this pretty much daily whenever I learn anything.

## VIM AND EXAMPLE_TEXT FILES
The example text file is to make sure that the file io in the cheatsheet functions properly. The vim is a version of the 
vim learning sheet, figured I'd put it in there because if you don't use vim, are you really coding?

## REPLIT LINK
If you want to run it (no need, enough comments to get what it does), here's the replit link.
